# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Design and Analysis of Algorithms focuses on studying algorithms through natural and historical perspectives, emphasizing solutions to complex problems. The course covers data structures like **n-ary trees**, **AVL trees**, **tries**, **graphs**, and **skip lists**, alongside algorithms such as sorting, backtracking, string matching, and shortest path algorithms.

Assignments link theory to real-world applications, exploring data structure choices for tasks like submission throttling with tries, building recommendation engines, and optimizing user-defined heap memory. By fostering intuition and a structured approach, the course equips engineers to design efficient algorithms and enhance existing ones for real-world impact.
